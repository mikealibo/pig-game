# pig-game

- score = global score

- round score = current score collected into the dice roll


# RULES :
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- The first player who reach the score of 100 score will be the winner.
- "ROLL" has the ability to roll the dice and add it into your round score.
- "HOLD" has the ability to add your round score into your score.

# Note

- Once you get the roll 1 into your dice this means the next player has the ability to roll the dice.
- So, dont just keep rolling the dice because once you get a roll 1, all of your round score will become 0.
